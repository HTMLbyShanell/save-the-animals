                    <p>  Animals in circuses spend about 11 months of the year traveling. For thousands of hours, over long distances, they may be chained while not performing, transported in vehicles that lack climate control, and forced to stand or lie in their own waste. </p>

                    <p> In the wild, elephants live in large, sociable herds and walk up to 30 miles every day - this is more than a circus elephant will walk in its entire life. Most other wild animals found in circus settings, including lions and tigers, are also constantly on the move in their native habitats. Depriving these animals of the freedom to roam, interact naturally with members of their species, and engage in other instinctual behaviors is inherently cruel.</p>

                    <p> To read more about circus animal cruelty, please visit the <u> <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.bornfreeusa.org/campaigns/animals-in-captivity/circuses/">website</a> </u>where I have learned of this information. <em>(Born Free USA, 2019)</em> </p> <!-- added an underline tag since in CSS I wanted to remove the default hyperlink tag from the "Save The Animals" logo in the header link-->
